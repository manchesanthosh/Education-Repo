# Problem Statement:
Educational resources are scattered across the web, in libraries, and in classrooms. This makes it difficult for learners to find the resources they need, especially if they are looking for something specific or if they are not familiar with the educational landscape. An educational hub would solve this problem by providing a one-stop shop for all things education. It would curate high-quality resources from a variety of sources and make them easily searchable and accessible to learners of all ages and backgrounds.
The growing popularity of online learning has created a demand for more centralized and accessible educational resources. The lack of a central hub can make it difficult for learners to find resources that are aligned with their curriculum or learning goals.  An education hub could provide access to free resources.
